# Fourier_Viz

This repository contains animated visualization of approximated patterns or drawing using [Fourier Series](https://brilliant.org/wiki/fourier-series/). 

### Implemented Approximations

 - [Square Wave] (https://rysul119.github.io/1Fourier_Viz-master) 
 - [Sawtooth Wave] (https://rysul119.github.io/1Fourier_Viz-master/viz_sawtooth.html)

### Soon to Arrive

 - Drawing any shapes or patterns using [Discrete Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform).

To animate the visualization [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a JavaScript library for artists and designers, is used. Examples of using p5 are demonstrated in the `HTML` files of this repository. Otherwise, one can add the line below inside the `<head>` tag of their `HTML` file:
